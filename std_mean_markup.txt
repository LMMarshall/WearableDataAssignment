The mean table shows the standard deviation and mean variables from Reyes-Ortiz et al's "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0". 

It is tidy:
- There is one variable per column, and each row represents a single measurement
- I included descriptive column names for each variable. I renamed "subject" to "participant" for clarity, renamed the activities from numbers to 
descriptive nouns, and I pulled the names from the features.txt as headers for the variables columns. They were already quite descriptive, 
so I didn't change them much -- I just cleaned them up a bit, removing excess punctuation for ease of readability.
- I arranged the data in order of participant ID number, where it was previously out of order.
- This data set includes a script in R, "run_analysis.R" that shows the explicit recipe to go from the original raw data set to the tidy set. It is
clearly annotated.
- It includes the relevant original raw data from the original data set
- The resulting data.table is saved in its own separate file.

The variables in this data set represent the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ from use of a Samsung wearable. 
Per the original documentation:

"These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter 
and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated 
into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 
0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, 
tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."

Note that only the standard deviations and means of these measurements are included in this dataset.
